Failed to load the ESLint library for the document /home/aelius/dev/my_projects/portfolio/themes/hugo-strata-theme/static/js/main.js

To use ESLint please install eslint by running npm install eslint in the workspace folder portfolio
or globally using 'npm install -g eslint'. You need to reopen the workspace after installing eslint.

If you are using yarn or pnpm instead of npm set the setting `eslint.packageManager` to either `yarn` or `pnpm`
Alternatively you can disable ESLint for the workspace folder portfolio by executing the 'Disable ESLint' command.
